        <h3>Description</h3>
        <h4>The most effective wayfinding systems are invisible. They belong to urban spaces and only when appropriate emphasis is placed on their identification, it is possible to see how they overwhelm the space by being visible at literally every corner. In most cases, they vanish in the air, unnoticed, subconsciously guiding the passengers through uncharted spaces. This was the case in Berlin.
          <p>On my first evening in Berlin I decided to go to a restaurant located on the other side of the city, 37 minutes away by public transport. To be honest, if it hadn't been for the multiple references of Yours Truly to the passenger information systems in Berlin, I would never have paid much attention to how comfortable my trip was. I traveled halfway through a city in a country I hadn't visited, and yet it felt so familiar. It just worked.</p>

        <h3>(Re)branding of Berlin’s public transport </h3>
        <h4>The Berliner underground system, the U-Bahn, was built in the 1880s in response to a growing population and increased traffic. Shortly after World War II, in 1961, Berlin was divided into a Soviet-controlled eastern part and a democratic western part. Traffic between the two parts was strictly restricted and the U-Bahn lines that connected the two sections had to be adapted to correspond to this requirement. As the division was artificially enforced, for almost 30 years passengers boarded the U-Bahn in West Berlin traveled under the East Berlin, and could not get off the train until they reached West Berlin again <u><a href="https://theculturetrip.com/europe/germany/berlin/articles/what-u-bahns-typography-can-tell-you-about-berlins-history/" target=“_blank”>(Culture Trip)</a></u>. Stops in East Berlin then became known as "ghost stations" and were meticulously supervised by officers.
          <p>After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the city was faced with the challenge of creating an integrated transport system for two distinct parts. MetaDesign, led by Eric Spiekermann (oh what a surprise!), was given the opportunity to rebrand and recreate the Berlin Transit System (BVG).</p>
          <p>Spiekermann discusses the difficulty of finding an effective solution, "the new information system had to look distinct from either of the two existing systems to avoid confusion" <u><a href="https://spiekermann.com/en/" target="_blank">(Spiekerblog)</a></u>. He adds that the lack of a common denominator influenced distrust in the system, “buses, trams, underground trains and ferries all had different liveries which stemmed from a time when they had been run by separate companies”. MetaDesign proposed a unification of the brand identity with yellow as a primary color featured in the logo, on every vehicle and every bus or tram stop. In addition, the blue, red, purple and green symbols indicate individual services within BVG. Spiekermann points out that thanks to the rebranding “Berliners know that you can trust any large yellow vehicle to get them to their destination … it’s the trusted friend for getting around the place” (Spiekerblog).</p>

        <h3>History told through typography</h3>
        <h4>In the 1990s MetaDesign introduced FF Transit, a corporate typeface of the BVG. The application of a standard signage is rather theoretical, as fonts differ between lines and stations thus telling passengers a fascinating story about the Berliner Art. On the stations in the U8 line, built at the time of the first world war one can come across Octopuss font designed by Colin Brignall. It’s a lovely grotesque sans serif lettering with a close resemblance to the New Johnston font in use on the London Underground since 1916.</p>
          <p>Along the U7 between Berlinerstraße and Rathaus Spandau, one can transport himself from the 70’s pop art to the 80s postmodernism. On the U3 line, opened in 1913, signs are influenced by the Wilhelmine era. They have been built “in a neoclassical style with stuccoed walls, period columns and mosaic station signs that spell out the names in confident capitals”. Just a few stops away, yet another sign is spelled out in late 70s Helvetica. In a different location the signage is featured in a monolinear grotesque, Jaroslav typeface designed by Tomas Brousil.</p>
